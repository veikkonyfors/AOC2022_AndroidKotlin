# Advent of Code 2022 Day12 HillClimbing

First puzzle solved with GUI.
1st fragment's button click opens a snackbar with action 1stpuzzle
which will update textview with the answer.
Uh Huh, not intuitive at all. But a good lesson to learn.

Second puzzle solved with GUI.
Got to second puzzle (fragment) and push SOLVE button.

One can navigate back and forth in puzzle fragments.  
Unfortunately the answer is lost in navigation.  
Should've implemented a viewmodel to retain data through navigations.
