# Advent of Code 2022 Day13 Distress Signal

Used BottomNavigation sample GUI to start with.
Using Fragments, ViewModel, Binding and LiveData.

For first puzzle, made use of script input_to_list.sh to create lists of signals, 
as didn't catch the logic how to parse the signals with kotlin to create the lists.
Signal lists had to be created in two parts, as one buch was too big for Kotlin compiler.

For the second puzzle took the time to do a recursive signal parser for the input.
