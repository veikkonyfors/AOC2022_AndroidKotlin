# Advent of Code 2022

This repository holds solutions from day12 onwards.
Up to day12 python solutions are located at AOC2022_pycharm repo.
Dropped off the sledge on day12. Switched to AndroidStudio and Kotlin from there on,
just in order to familiarize myself more with this environment.

Solutions are available as submodules, e.g. day12hillclimbing.

Not sure if this project as a whole is a forkable entity.
