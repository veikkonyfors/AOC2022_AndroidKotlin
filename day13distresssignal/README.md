# Advent of Code 2022 Day13 Distress Signal

First puzzle solved with GUI.

Using Fragments and ViewModel.
Used script input_to_list.sh to create lists of signals, as didn't catch the logic how to
parse the signals with kotlin to create the lists.
Signal lists had to be created in two parts, as one buch was too big for Kotlin compiler.
